            <h1>Camera</h1>
            <p><b>Choosing The Right Camera To Keep Moments More Special</b><br>
                Photographs have never been this popular. Cameras are virtually everywhere! You’ve got one built in your laptop, two on your mobile phones and tablets, and you’ve got choices that range from the standard and compact point and shoot cameras as well as heavy and bulky digital single lens reflex cameras, more commonly known as the DSLR.
                <br><br>
                You see photos everywhere, be it in your own home, your office, and more than ever in your social media accounts with Instagram as the prime app most people with a smartphone have. With the rise of the photo taking frenzy in this generation, it’s still wise to invest on a dedicated camera to suit your snapshot-trigger-happy needs. That despite the popularity and convenience of having photos instantly uploaded online, it’s also a good and meaningful idea to still keep a dedicated camera to take photos for you to keep, to cherish, to print and to put in a frame without sacrificing quality.
                <br><br>
                <b>Cameras remain a worthy investment</b><br>
                With photo sharing apps gaining more popularity than ever, the true beauty and the art of capturing photos using either a simple and compact point and shoot camera or a DSLR is sometimes set aside. However, our modern smartphones will never match the capabilities and specifications a standalone camera has. We’ve rounded up the reasons why a point and shoot camera, or a mirrorless camera, or even a DSLR remains to be a wise buy.
                <br><br>
                <b>Picture Quality</b><br>
                The main advantage cameras offer above a smartphone is picture quality. Smartphone photographs can be amazing but they aren’t as versatile as the ones compact cameras take. As renowned photographer Nigel Atherton said, “Camera phones are fine for photographing static subjects in good light but dedicated cameras are still superior with moving subjects and in low or difficult lighting. Their larger sensors ensure that image quality is better in all kinds of light, the battery life is usually better, the flash more powerful and the lenses generally offer at least 10x zoom, none of which camera phones can compete with.”
                <br><br>
                <b>Lens Versatility</b><br>
                For most photographers, being able to control the zoom is an invaluable tool for composition and a way to capture a remote subject. “The key advantage for a compact camera is the true optical zoom lens capability. Some cameras reach staggering magnification factors perfect for bringing the unreachable closer without digital enhancement,” says a renowned Jessops (a British photography retail store) representative, Ian Savage.
                <br><br>
                <b>Battery</b><br>
                The many features in a smartphone can cause its battery to run out much quicker - you’ve got Wi-Fi or data, games, and other apps and that’s one of the smartphone’s drawbacks. DSLRs, point and shoot cameras, and even mirrorless cameras on the other hand, can typically take 200 to 400 photos before the battery starts to run out.
                <br><br>
                <b>The Battle: Cameras vs Smartphone Cameras</b><br>
                If you are a more serious photographer who wants to experiment with shutter and aperture and develop your own photography skills, it is definitely worth buying a camera, particularly with manual control and a versatile lens like DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. However, if you are the kind of person who simply wants to take photographs without sacrificing picture quality, a compact point and shoot camera is for you. The cameras in most smartphones tend to have cheaper photographic components to keep the cost down, so the pictures won’t be as good compared to DSLRs, mirrorless cameras, or even the point and shoot ones.
                <br><br>
                <b>Choose The Ideal Camera</b><br>
                If you’re going to be running after kids to take their pictures, you probably don’t want a big, and bulky DSLR, but instead go for a point and shoot camera or a mirrorless one. But if you want the best, biggest, most controllable photos money can possibly buy, make sure you invest in a camera you can grow into. DSLRs offer more control and more choices in picking out the suitable lenses, and they’re capable of capturing a wider range of photos and high definition videos as well.</p>
